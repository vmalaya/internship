# mockito

[Mockito] is a mocking framework that helps to isolate all dependency
around testing unit. 
It works with any test unit testing library as Junit or TestNG.  
You can use static method mock() or annotation for testing.
Also there is [BDDMockito] that helps to test in BDD style.
See additional [reference]
